# Movie Recommendation System

I implement a content-based movie recommendation system. The system recommends movies similar to a given movie title based on features extracted from movie metadata.

## Project Overview

The recommendation system uses a dataset of movies from kaggle and their credits to suggest similar movies. The process involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and computing similarity scores to generate recommendations.

## Future improvements

I will make a web interface where you can search films and their recommandations

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `ast`
- `nltk`
- `pickle`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
```
